# XOR Federated Learning with `syft_flwr`: A "Hello World" Example

This document outlines a "hello world" style example for federated learning using the simple XOR dataset with `syft_flwr`. The goal is to provide an accessible entry point for users to understand and participate in federated learning.

## The Concept

The core idea is a two-part tutorial:

1.  **Train on the Network:** Users can immediately start training a model on a pre-existing, distributed network of datasites, each hosting the XOR dataset.
2.  **Join the Network:** Users can then setup their own datasite, load the XOR dataset onto it, and become part of this growing federated learning network.

This approach allows new users to quickly experience federated learning and then contribute to the ecosystem.

## Part 1: Training your XOR Model

This part of the tutorial will guide you through the process of finding a random subsection of datasites within the network that host the XOR dataset and training a simple model across them.

The XOR dataset is very small and simple:

**X (Inputs)**
```
[0,0]
[0,1]
[1,0]
[1,1]
```

**Y (Outputs)**
```
[0]
[1]
[1]
[0]
```

The aim is to keep the code required to submit a training job minimal, ideally under 50 lines, and perhaps even as few as 15 lines.

## Part 2: Deploy Your Own XOR Datasite

After successfully training a model on the existing network, the second part of the tutorial will show you how to:

1.  Set up your own `syftbox` datasite.
2.  Load the XOR dataset onto your datasite.
3.  Make your datasite available for others to use in their XOR federated learning experiments.

By completing this part, you actively contribute to the scalability of this "hello world" example. As more users deploy their XOR datasites, the network becomes more robust and diverse.

## Why XOR?

Using the XOR dataset offers several advantages for a "hello world" example:

*   **Simplicity:** The dataset is tiny and the problem is well-understood, making it easy to focus on the federated learning aspects.
*   **Minimal Code:** The simplicity allows for a very concise training script.
*   **Fast Iteration:** Training is quick, allowing for rapid experimentation.

## Scalability and Vision

This "XOR Hello World" is designed to be inherently scalable. The number of available datasites (computers willing to accept XOR jobs) can grow in proportion to the number of people trying to train XOR AI models.

**Future Ideas:**

*   **Blog Post Tutorial:** A comprehensive blog post could guide users through setting up, say, 10-100 test datasites with the XOR dataset.
*   **Path to Real-World Data:** A small percentage of these users might then proceed to a "Part 3," where they load more complex and realistic datasets (e.g., "Netflix data" or other private datasets), paving a scalable path to more significant commitments and deployments with minimal initial relationship management.

This example aims to be an exciting and accessible entry point into the world of federated learning with `syft_flwr`!
